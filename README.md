## 🛠️ Expertise & Interests

### 🌐 Web Development  
I architect **full-stack applications** that blend seamless frontends with robust backends:  
- **Frontend**: Crafting dynamic, responsive UIs with **React**, **Redux**, and **TypeScript**. Recent project: A real-time dashboard with 98% Lighthouse performance score.  
- **Backend**: Powering apps with **PHP**, **Node.js**, and **Express**, integrated with **MariaDB** and **MongoDB**. Implemented secure APIs handling 10K+ requests/day.  
- **Tools**: Webpack, Vite, Docker, CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions).  

### 🔐 Cybersecurity  
As an **ethical hacker**, I secure systems by exposing weaknesses:  
- Conducted **penetration testing** for 5+ web apps, identifying SQL injection and XSS flaws.  
- Built **security tools** for automated vulnerability scanning, used by 200+ devs on GitHub.  
- Expertise in **OWASP Top 10**, network auditing, and exploit development with **Metasploit** and **Burp Suite**.  
- Advocate for **secure coding** (e.g., parameterized queries, JWT auth).  

### 🛠️ Open Source  
I contribute to tools that empower developers:  
- Enhanced a **PHP framework** with 15% faster routing.  
- Developed **CLI utilities** for automation, adopted by 50+ users.  
- Active in **security** and **web dev** repos—check my pinned projects!  

### 📱 Mobile & Cloud  
Bridging platforms with cutting-edge tech:  
- Building **cross-platform apps** with **React Native** and **Flutter** (e.g., a prototype with 500+ beta testers).  
- Deploying scalable systems on **AWS** (EC2, Lambda), **Azure**, and **GCP**. Migrated a legacy app to serverless, cutting costs by 30%.  

### 📊 Data & AI  
Turning data into insights:  
- Optimized **SQL/NoSQL** queries for 40% faster response times.  
- Experimenting with **machine learning** models (TensorFlow, Python) for predictive analytics.  
- Built a **data pipeline** processing 1M+ records with Apache Kafka.
